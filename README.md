<br>This app was the first project where I employed `forwardRef ` to manage focus, the most involved part of the project. I am very proud of this project because I managed to implement all the necessary a11y features.

<br>
<br>ðŸ”Ž Here are the key technical aspects of the application:
<br>

<br>**React Hooks**: I used multiple React Hooks to manage state and side effects in the application. 
- `useState` hook to initialize and manage state for the `dice` and `tenzies` variables. 
- `useEffect` hook to check if the dice are held and all dice have the same value. 
- `useRef` hook to manage the focus on the first dice.

**forwardRef Function**: It is my first time using the `useRef` and `forwardRef`. I ran into issues trying to manage focus. From reading the documentation I learned that the `forwardRef` and `useRef` can be employed for that purpose. The `forwardRef` function is necessary to create a reference for the `Die` component. This allowed me to pass a `ref` from the parent component `App` to the child component `Die`, giving the parent direct access to the child's DOM node. 

**Dynamic component rendering**: I used the `map` function (my favorite!!!) to dynamically create a `Die` component for each element in the `dice` array. This is a common pattern in React for creating multiple instances of a component based on an array of data. 

**Conditional rendering**: As is often the case in React, my app relies on conditional rendering to alter the UI based on the game state. For example, the `Roll` button's text changes to "New Game" when the player wins.

**Immutable state updates**: When updating the dice array, my app creates a new array instead of mutating the old one directly. This adheres to React's principle of immutable state updates. 

**Third-party libraries used:**
- the `nanoid` library to generate a unique identifier for each die. 
- the `react-confetti` library to show a confetti animation when a player wins.

**CSS-in-JS**: I used inline styles to dynamically change the background color of the `Die` component based on whether it's held or not.

**Accessibility**: I utilized ARIA properties for better accessibility and keyboard user experience:
- `aria-label` to provide a text description for screen readers
- `tabIndex` property to specify the tab order of an element
- `aria-live` after a win is linked to the congratulations message
- focus goes to first die at initial render
- frozen dice 
- prevents freeze unless value = value of other frozen dice
- focus returns to button after win and during play

**Flexbox and CSS Grid** to layout the components on the screen and enable a responsive design.
